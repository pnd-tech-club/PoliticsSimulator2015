# PoliticsSimulator2015 \<WIP\>
>Largely Unnecessary

##What's in the Tin:

- The "svi" package provided in the SVIOS repository
- The "PoliticsSimulator2015" _game_ by `main.go` and support files (once they exist)
- Not Go

##To Build:

1. Run the `cpsvi` script in `src/` (makes dir/copies/installs `svi.go` using your `$GOPATH`) (This is in the SVIOS repository)
2. Change directory back to the location of `main.go`
3. Build PoliticsSimulator2015 via `go build`
4. Run via `./PoliticsSimulator2015`
5. Enjoy

##Notes:

This project is silly.
