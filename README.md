# PoliticsSimulator2015 \<WIP\>
>Largely Unnecessary

##What's in the Tin:

- The "svi" package provided by `Packages/svi.go`
- The "PoliticsSimulator2015" _game_ by `main.go` and support files (once they exist)
- Not Go

##To Build:

1. Copy `Packages/svi.go` to the `$GOPATH/src` folder
2. Install the "svi" package via `go install svi`
3. Change directory back to the location of `main.go`
4. Build PoliticsSimulator2015 via `go build`
5. Run via `./PoliticsSimulator2015`
6. Enjoy

##Notes:

This project is silly.
